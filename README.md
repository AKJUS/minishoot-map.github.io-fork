# Minishoot' Adventures map

[Minishoot' Adventures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634860/Minishoot_Adventures/) is a bullet-hell adventure game that combines the frantic joy and game feel of shoot'em ups with Zelda-like exploration and Metroidvania-style secrets.


This project provides an interactive map for the game, available [here](https://minishoot-map.github.io/).
The map shows collectables, crystal coins, passages, and many more.
The map is based on extracted in-game data.
