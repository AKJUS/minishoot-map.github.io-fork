# Minishoot' Adventures map

[Minishoot' Adventures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634860/Minishoot_Adventures/) is a bullet-hell adventure game that combines the frantic joy and game feel of shoot'em ups with Zelda-like exploration and Metroidvania-style secrets.


This project provides an interactive map for the game, available [here](https://minishoot-map.github.io/).
The map shows collectables, crystal coins, passages, and many more.
The map is based on extracted in-game data.

I had to create a new github organization because google doesn't support more than 1
favicon per domain. Also I need to push something rn, since github pages overwrote my
"fork actions consent" page, and the usual Vite workflow didn't run.
